                            Pathayapura(granary). Located in the modest village
                            of Pallasena, this homestay peacefully resides in
                            the backdrop of Nelliyampathy hills surrounded by

                            escape the mundane activities of your daily life. It
                            is located on 10 acres of land and caters to three
                            spacious rooms that have been personally restored by
                            its owners that come with a story. You shall be

                            Mankav kalam was previously the family home of
                            Unniytans. Since the couple grew old and their 2
                            children away from the native, they decided to sell
                            the property. Their nephew brought out the plan to a
                            group of 5 friends, who were interested in investing
                            in their childhood village and give a new meaning to
                            the place and bought Mankav Kalam.

                            Palakkad; Krishna Vilas is an 80-year-old elegant
                            tharavad, a best-kept family secret. Influenced by
                            Tamil architecture, this heritage home is a place to
                            detox and de-tech.

                            Krishna Vilas was built in 1930 by Shri M Krishnan.
                            This heritage property was built as a gift for his
                            daughter Subhadra for bringing luck and prosperity
                            to the family. It is a tharavad; which follows a
                            matrilineal system of the joint family by the Nairs
                            in Kerala.

                            Spending a considerable amount of time in Tamil
                            Nadu, Shri M Krishnan Nair built Krishna Vilas
                            having influenced by Tamil architecture. This
                            property features a courtyard that has two wings;
                            centered between the main building and kitchen, a
                            voluminous dining hall, terrace, a stylish veranda,
                            and a garden rightly fit to relax.

                          <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                            Having stood the test of time, Krishna Vilas was
                            revived and restored by the great- grandson of Shri
                            M Krishnan Nair and his wife. The details of
                            carpentry in this heritage property remain untouched
                            without making any sweeping changes, a testimony to
                            the great artisanship of the time.

                            This property and the surrounding land were received
                            as a gift for Late Ms. Meenakshi Amma from her
                            husband. In the year 1854, they constructed a
                            magnificent home and named it Meenikode Kalam. She
                            was then honored as the great matriarch of the
                            family.

                            heritage home was restored carefully, by its fifth
                            generation without compromising the character of
                            this place. In the courtyard of this property, a
                            very large bronze vessel called Ururli has been
                            placed. It is a cooking vessel of the past and
                            signifies the prosperity of the family.
