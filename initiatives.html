              delicacy of associations we have with our partners. We believe in

                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        Many of the greatest civilizations we know of, thrived
                        and prospered around the availability of water
                        resources. Our land also has a long-standing affiliation
                        with such beautiful man- made canals. It operates as a
                        nerve centre for our agricultural needs and transforms
                        the livelihood of the people in eastern Palakkad. Also,
                        these canals flow across gorgeous landscapes that
                        connect people and their diverse subcultures.

                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        As a travel company, our effort was greatly involved in
                        uncovering the magic of this unseen ecosystem. Our team
                        vehemently pursued connecting the stories of a culture
                        so fragile and succeeded in recognizing its potential.
                        In due course, a trail was unearthed that had all the
                        right ingredients for a unique experience and we named
                        it My Cycle and the Canal Stories. It provided a cycling
                        experience so diverse, as our guests had the joy of
                        exploring the intricacies of culture. A culture, that is
                        vibrant for its agriculture, communities, cuisine,
                        architecture, and art forms.

                        Keeping in mind the requirements of the differently
                        abled travellers, Moksha Stories incorporated a humble
                        effort to encourage such children to enjoy travel
                        likewise everyone. ‘Mokshanubhava’ was one such
                        initiative to help differently-abled children to
                        participate in active travel. Our team in association
                        with Palakkad Blind Foundation made this feat possible.
                        13 children and their families joined us for this day
                        tour. We curated this project in a manner that
                        integrated the dominating senses like touch, sound,
                        taste, and smell. We featured art forms, artisans, a
                        garden walk, and dishes from our cuisine that enabled
                        these children to take part in the activities we
                        offered.

                        An affair with Regeneration
                      </h3>
                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        Palakkad is a land that takes pride in having many
                        opulent heritage homes. Properties with grandeur designs
                        were once landmarks of history and prosperity, many
                        awaiting their epilogue to be written in due course of
                        time. In an effort to make the past relevant to the
                        future, we involve in thoughtful restoration and
                        regeneration projects to revive such heritage
                        properties. The restoration of 100-year-old Mankav Kalam
                        in the village of Pallasena, Palakkad is a notable one.

                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        Once having decided to purchase the property and its
                        surrounding farmlands from the previous owner, Moksha
                        Stories began the restoration of Mankav Kalam. It was a
                        century-old property with a granary called Pathayapura
                        to store grains. All its aesthetics and details were
                        kept intact without making sweeping changes. Three rooms
                        were installed with the special skills and knowledge of
                        local craftsmen who understood the complexities and
                        geometries of this property. The wood and wooden works
                        were procured from nearby schools and tharavadu.

                        Stories of Agriculture
                      </h3>
                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        Palakkad is one of the districts in Kerala where you can
                        find agriculture as a prominent occupation of the
                        people. It is also widely known as the Granary of
                        Kerala. A land famed for harvesting rice breeds like
                        Matta, Njavara, Thavala Kannan, etc. Thanks to our
                        agrarian culture, though fading has stood the test of
                        time. Notably, in Eastern Palakkad, our life mainly
                        revolves around agriculture and its various practices.
                      </p>
                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        Agriculture has a huge influence on the countless
                        traditions one sees here. Due to its fertile soils, many
                        communities had made this land their home. These
                        communities also brought along their customs and
                        traditions. Hence one can find a plenitude of rituals,
                        festivals, oral traditions, etc. This has also
                        influenced our art forms and culture as a whole.
                      </p>
                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        As a travel company founded by millennials, we wanted to
                        do our bit. This made us motivated to agriculture in the
                        6 acres of paddy farmlands surrounding the Mankav Kalam
                        heritage homestay. We take pride in actively taking part
                        in farming indigenous varieties, notably Matta (brown
                        rice with high content of bran). Most of the people
                        working on our farms are women.

                        A bouquet for our resolute women
                      </h3>
                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        Even before the inception of Moksha Stories, our
                        connection with agriculture was imminent. Thanks to our
                        humble agrarian backgrounds, which laid a strong sense
                        of the need to upheave the farming culture and lives
                        associated with it. We realized that it was the women
                        and their labour that goes behind any flourished crop.
                        The women of our land; iron-willed yet delicate and
                        loving at their core.
                      </p>
                      <p class="section_para animatable fadeInUp">
                        It was these insights that laid the foundation for our
                        project- Mud Fest. A project to celebrate our women, our
                        unsung heroes. The concept of this one-day program
                        mainly focuses on the need for us to go back to the
                        roots, to the mud, and reclaim our association with -
                        Our Mother Earth. Our team members curated this event in
                        and around Mankav Kalam’s homestay incorporating
                        activities like pottery, playing games in the swampy
                        fields, folklore, and dining together with our
                        communities.
