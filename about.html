                  Sreejith always had an inclination towards folklore and local
                  arts since his college days. He used to spend his weekends
                  travelling where he found out about indigenous communities
                  that practiced familial crafts. He felt the urgent requirement
                  of documenting and uplifting these crafts which were beginning
                  to disappear as the artists no longer could make a livelihood
                  by merely performing their age-old traditions. He understood
                  that tourism could change the fates of these crafts and the
                  artists alike, if their work is being appreciated. Moksha
                  stories have been a game changer in this travel niche and
                  Sreejith stands true to its vision, sparing a sense of pride
                  in everything we do to everyone involved. He is an ex-retail
                  banker.
